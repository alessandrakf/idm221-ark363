</header>

<main>
<div class="container"><p>If you’ve read any of my other blog posts, you know I go crazy over brunch! When on vacations and weekends it is my favorite meal of the day, so I obviously had to capitalize on all the insane restaurants London has to offer. Keep reading to find out all about my favorite brunch spots in London!</p></div>

<h2><a href="https://aubaine.co.uk/our-restaurants/brompton-road/menus/all-day-dining/" target="_blank">Aubaine</a></h2>
    <p>This bright, flower adorned brunch is a must-visit! Located right off High Street in Kensington, <a href="https://aubaine.co.uk/our-restaurants/brompton-road/menus/all-day-dining/" target="_blank">Aubaine</a> is conveniently located next to Hyde Park, Kensington Palace, and most importantly… shopping! There are also multiple locations throughout London. You truly can’t go wrong when dining here as there is something for everyone in the group. From sweet to savory, we were not disappointed. I do have to admit that I came here twice in a five day span… That’s how good it is! I have personally eaten the French toast and the eggs benedict here, and although both were delicious, I think I craved the French toast for about a week after. The setting was beautiful with Veuve Clicquot used as decoration throughout, along with artificial flowers and surrounded by windows. Overall, I would definitely go back!</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thefarmgirl.co.uk/" target="_blank">Farm Girl</a></h2>
    <p>All I can say is WOW! I am ecstatic that I discovered this spot. <a href="https://www.thefarmgirl.co.uk/" target="_blank">Farm Girl</a> has multiple locations throughout London and is a bright, colorful, and aesthetically pleasing spot in each one. The Chelsea location features a ceiling window surrounded by thriving pothos plants that lets in amazing natural light (perfect for that Instagram-worthy shot). I had their soup of the day which was a lentil, butternut squash, and spinach soup and it did NOT disappoint! I also had a taste of the “Salmon Party” which is smoked salmon, beet cream cheese, and poached egg on sourdough. I would definitely recommend this dish if you like smoked salmon!</p>
    <p>I can’t forget to mention their unreal drink selection… Along with my soup I ordered a rose matcha latte with oat milk, which was also delicious. The rose was not overpowering and I did NOT feel like I was drinking the infamous Mario Badescu spray. They have every latte from lavender to matcha to butterfly to chai. The butterfly latte is an organic blue matcha with almond milk, and the chai latte comes with the cinnamon sprinkled on in the shape of an adorable dog!!</p>
    <p>This is the perfect place if you want to eat healthy as they have breakfast bowl options, smoothies, juices, and wellness shots! It is also worth noting that a lot of their food is gluten-free.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.bandhbuildings.com/" target="_blank">Bourne & Hollingsworth</a></h2>
    <p>One word: Bottomless. This hip, bright restaurant is perfect for brunch and drinks. Not only is the drink deal amazing (bottomless Bloody Mary’s and Bellini’s), but the food was to die for. My friend and I split the drip scone pancakes and the huevos benedicto. Can I just say that those pancakes are next level and have redefined my standards for pancakes. If you are a pancake-lover then you NEED to try these! The eggs benedict was also delicious – the sausage was cooked to perfection and the components of the dish worked together to create an amazing and unique benedict! The atmosphere at <a href="https://www.bandhbuildings.com/" target="_blank">Bourne & Hollingsworth</a> was trendy, plant filled, and perfect for a sunny day as the lighting is amazing! There are fun design choices, such as a bathtub used for a sink in the restroom, and a piano as their hostess table. Overall, a definite visit if you are a bottomless bruncher!!</p>

<h2><a href="https://thebreakfastclubcafes.com/" target="_blank">The Breakfast Club</a></h2>
    <p>Adorned with bacon-loving decorations, <a href="https://thebreakfastclubcafes.com/" target="_blank">The Breakfast Club</a> is a fun spot if you are looking for a spot that has something for everyone. Similar to a diner style menu, there are many breakfast options ranging from healthier (think vegetable bowls and juices) to your typical menu items. They also have a milkshakes and cocktails if you are looking to have a boozy brunch. I went to the Breakfast Club in Shoreditch for brunch, but there are locations open later with a Happy Hour from 6-8pm. The majority of my group got pancakes, and then we split chicken and waffles for the table.</p>

<h2><a href="https://eggbreak.com/" target="_blank">Eggbreak</a></h2>
    <p><a href="https://eggbreak.com/" target="_blank">Eggbreak</a> is a bustling all-day kitchen located in the adorable Notting Hill. They do not take reservations and their menu features unusual but perfectly paired items. An example of this would be my order, which was avocado toast over jalapeño cornbread and topped with a poached egg. My friend ordered crab cake benedict, and we got the pancakes for the table. Everything that I had a taste for was absolutely delicious! They also have juices, smoothies, and yummy cocktails. You truly cannot go wrong with ordering anything here, and I would highly recommend!</p>

<h2><a href="https://hotboxlondon.co.uk/" target="_blank">Hotbox</a></h2>
    <p>This BBQ restaurant features something most places do not: bottomless brunch every day of the week. <a href="https://hotboxlondon.co.uk/" target="_blank">Hotbox</a>, located in the artsy Spitalfields area, is brunch with a smoked meats twist. For example, instead of traditional eggs benedict, they do pork belly benedict, and their brunch menu includes six types of burgers. It was absolutely amazing! I started out with a bloody mary and then finished off my bottomless with Bellini’s, and for brunch I had the waffle chicken. My group got the smoked pork belly for the table which I enjoyed, but my friend did not as he thought that it was grainy, dry, and flavorless. He ate the breakfast burger and enjoyed it a lot though! If you are stopping in the Shoreditch or Spitalfields area, Hotbox is an awesome choice to dine at!</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.oldstreetrecords.com/" target="_blank">Old Street Records</a></h2>
    <p>This record spot, located in Shoreditch, is home to many different types of occasions. Whether you are looking to eat breakfast, brunch, lunch, pizza, grab a coffee, drink some juice, grab a cocktail, or listen to live music, <a href="https://www.oldstreetrecords.com/" target="_blank">Old St. Records</a> has got you covered. Every night they are open late have live music. My friends and I had just happened to walk past and noticed they were serving brunch, unbeknownst to us they were a popular nightlife spot. The dining area they had open for lunch time was quaint, and if you had to use the restroom, then the walk there definitely looked and smelled like they had a rowdy night the night before. Besides that, where we were seated was a pleasant experience, with records, neon signs, and hanging plants surrounding the area. I would recommend eating the avocado toast as they are extremely generous with the avocado and feta cheese, and the salmon bagel sandwich. The SEC (salmon, egg, & cheese) is the perfect bacon, egg, and cheese alternative for smoked salmon lovers!</p>
    <p>The food was delicious but the service was so-so. I am familiar with how different service is in Europe versus America, but it was like pulling teeth just getting our server to bring over water, and the dining area was not packed. Besides this, it was a yummy experience!</p>

<h2><a href="https://catalyst.cafe/" target="_blank">Catalyst Café</a></h2>
    <p><a href="https://catalyst.cafe/" target="_blank">Catalyst Café</a> features a large community table in the middle, with window seating across their two huge windows. The staff was extremely friendly and assisted us as we were slightly unfamiliar with their system. At the café, you order at the counter and wait for your food and coffee. They have filled water pitchers and cups by a sink that you can grab for yourself. I took my boyfriend here on his third day in London and he told me it was the best food he had so far (and I take him to A LOT of food places). I got the pancakes, which were so thick and featured a delicious grilled banana and other fruits, and he got the sausages which came with egg, sourdough bread, pickles, gravy, and avocado. Both dishes were absolutely amazing and I would most definitely revisit it here!</p>

<h2><a href="https://grangerandco.com/notting-hill" target="_blank">Granger & Co.</a></h2>
    <p>When my boyfriend visited me in London, we stayed in an AirBnB in Paddington. Every time we walked to Notting Hill we passed <a href="https://grangerandco.com/notting-hill" target="_blank">Granger & Co.</a> And every time there was a line wrapping around the building, so I told him that if we ever pass and there is no line, we HAVE to eat there. That’s just what we did! The restaurant originated in Australia and the aesthetics in the dining area definitely reflect that. I ordered the ricotta hotcakes and he ordered the fresh Aussie. They were both excellent and definitely worth the hype! The atmosphere was bright, colorful and happy which was influenced by our friendly server. There are a couple locations throughout London so pop by a Granger & Co. next visit!</p>

<h2><a href="http://mayfair.popina.co.uk/" target="_blank">Popina</a></h2>
    <p><a href="http://mayfair.popina.co.uk/" target="_blank">Popina</a> was the last brunch I had in London before I got on the plane home. The location is small but had exactly what we needed! We got the French toast and a traditional English breakfast which was one of the best we had. It was a sweet ending to a wonderful time abroad and definitely hit the spot!</p>
