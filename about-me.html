<h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>My name is Alessandra and I am a college student living outside of  Philadelphia. I have a passion for trying new things, whether it be food, activities or skills! I am currently majoring in Marketing & Business Analytics with minors in Public Relations & Interactive Digital Media. This all started with my food Instagram citygoodeats and has expanded into this website, which holds an in-depth look at my study abroad experience, lists of where to eat in different cities, and weekend trip guides. In my little free time you can find me baking, lifting, practicing yoga or admiring my plants.</p>
    <p>I hope to eventually include what I like to cook and bake, how Iâ€™ve stayed (partially) sane during this quarantine, and other parts of my life.</p>
    <p>Please enjoy this small portion of me and look out for more exciting things to come!</p>
