    <h1>Exploring London's Cafés</h1>

<!-- Intro to article -->
<div class="container">
<p>I’ve posted my picks for London sweets and brunches, but I haven’t talked about my love for London cafés! I explored many London cafés during my time in London, and some of them I visited many times. Keep scrolling if you want to read about 7 of my favorite London cafés.</p>

<h2><a href="https://gailsbread.co.uk/" target="_blank">Gail's</a></h2>
    <p><a href="https://gailsbread.co.uk/" target="_blank">Gail's</a> was my <i>obsession</i> while I was studying abroad in London. The bakery is known for their freshly baked bread, pastries and cakes they make every day. My dorm was located in South Kensington which was right near my beloved Gail’s, and I visited there frequently. They have locations all throughout London (thank God) so I was never far from a Gail’s! I would go almost daily for either an espresso, a mini juice, or my favorite – breakfast! Gail’s was always there for me whether I needed a hangover feast, a midday pick up, or something sweet. The juice I swore by while abroad was from the Daily Dose and it contained apple, carrot, lemon, ginger and turmeric. I would drink them constantly! I visited multiple Gail’s throughout London and the quality was consistent throughout! Definitely check out this unforgettable café!</p>

<h2><a href="https://auxmerveilleux.com/en/content/6-our-story" target="_blank">Aux Merveilleux de Fred</a></h2>
    <p>Looking for a taste of France while visiting London? <a href="https://auxmerveilleux.com/en/content/6-our-story" target="_blank">Aux Merveilleux de Fred</a> has you covered. They put their own twist on the traditional merveilleux cakes, making them lighter and in multiple flavors, which became a popular product! A merveilleux (marvelous) is a small cake with whipped cream sandwiched between two light meringues and covered with whipped cream and dusted with chocolate shavings. I tried one of the chocolate merveilleux and it was like biting into a perfect chocolate cloud. Their chocolate chip cramique was also delightful and pairs perfectly with tea or coffee. I was lucky enough to purchase mine right from the oven so it was still warm! They also sell small brioches filled with fig jam/cheese and smoked salmon. I had an amazing experience here and can confidently say it is one of the best cafés in London!</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.paul-uk.com/" target="_blank">PAUL Bakery</a></h2>
    <p>Coming from America with chains like Dunkin Donuts and Starbucks, I was not prepared for <a href="https://www.paul-uk.com/" target="_blank">PAUL Bakery</a>. I’m not sure what residents in the UK and Europe think about PAUL, but it is the best dang coffee chain I’ve ever experienced. There are so many throughout London and I even saw them in Paris, but they deliver the same consistent quality throughout every PAUL I went to (which has to be over 10). I grabbed way too many double espresso’s from PAUL’s all over, and they always had a desirable snack to pair with my drink. The cafés also have insane baguette sandwiches and soups. Their assortment of desserts every day is insane – more cakes and tarts that you can imagine. And don’t even get me started about the croissants. I visited PAUL’s most days for my coffee and sometimes later in the day when I wanted something sweet in between classes! You can’t go wrong with PAUL – my friends and I would joke that he’s the only man we need! But it is true, PAUL kept me fueled with whatever I needed.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.brunningandprice.co.uk/cocomomokensington/" target="_blank">Coco Momo</a></h2>
    <p>Located conveniently near my dorm and school buildings, <a href="https://www.brunningandprice.co.uk/cocomomokensington/" target="_blank">Coco Momo</a> always had exactly what I needed! They are open seven days a week and serve breakfast, lunch and dinner from their seasonal all-day menu. I visited frequently for a quick bite before class, to do schoolwork over an iced coffee, or to grab a drink and dinner after class. If you ever find yourself in South Kensington, this café will definitely not disappoint!</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.oree.co.uk/" target="_blank">Orée</a></h2>
    <p>A little piece of rural France is brought to London by <a href="https://www.oree.co.uk/" target="_blank">Orée</a>. I wish I knew about the bakery sooner during my time abroad! The café bakes their morning pastries, artisan bread and fine patisseries fresh everyday along with breakfast sandwiches, salads and of course, coffees. It’s also helpful to know that they offer a range of gluten and dairy free products. There are a couple locations throughout London and it caught my eye when I would visit Covent Garden. Unfortunately for me, I hadn’t noticed it until my last 1-2 weeks abroad since it was my “spring break”. On my last full day in London, I finally decided I had to try it and I got a chocolate Nutella chouquette which was basically a little bite of heaven. With locations throughout various popular areas in London, you need to try this café!</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/music-and-beans-camden-london" target="_blank">Music + Beans</a></h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.yelp.com/biz/music-and-beans-camden-london" target="_blank">Music + Beans</a> is the perfect spot to stop by for a coffee and a quick bite during a visit to Camden market. I got an espresso and an avocado toast and it was fabulous! They are a local café serving coffee and healthy food. The atmosphere is lovely and filled with an assortment of guitars. Overall, it’s an amazing café to stop by if you are visiting Camden!</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.breadahead.com/" target="_blank">Bread Ahead</a></h2>
    <p>I passed <a href="https://www.breadahead.com/" target="_blank">Bread Ahead</a> while walking through Chelsea and after seeing the mountains of cinnamon rolls, I knew I needed to stop in. They have a variety of different baked goods and sandwiches that are perfect for an on-the-go meal. They have a couple locations throughout London, so definitely stop by this café if you happen upon it during your time in London!</p>
