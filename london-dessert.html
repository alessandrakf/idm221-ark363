<h1>10 of the Best Dessert Spots in London</h1>
<p>During my time studying abroad in London I made it a priority to seek out all of the best dessert spots in London. If you’ve read my previous posts than you know how passionate I am about brunch, but I haven’t shared with you my obsession with DESSERT! I personally have always enjoyed baking, and when I go out I always love to end on a sweet note. Keep scrolling if you want to read about all my favorite dessert spots in London!</p>

<br>

<h2><a href="https://said.it/en/" target="_blank">SAID dal 1923</a></h2>
    <p>One of my most memorable desserts was at <a href="https://said.it/en/" target="_blank">SAID dal 1923</a>, which is literally a cafe and shop that you can go to just for dessert. Located in London’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_End_of_London" target="_blank">West End</a>, this Italian café has sweets ranging from chocolates, cakes, biscuits, truffles and hot chocolates. I ordered a chocolate molten lava cake sort of thing served with whipped cream. It was insanely good. The atmosphere in the shop was romantic, featuring dimmed lights and a cozy vibe. I definitely recommend working this spot into any visit in London for a night cap!</p>

<br>

<h2><a href="https://www.softservesociety.com/" target="_blank">Soft Serve Society</a></h2>
    <p>There are two <a href="https://www.softservesociety.com/" target="_blank">Soft Serve Society</a> locations – I visited the one in Shoreditch. This spot is in one of my all-time London favorite’s: <a href="https://www.boxpark.co.uk/shoreditch/" target="_blank">Boxpark</a>. I will write about Boxpark on its own in another post featuring London’s food markets, but in summary it is a popular spot in Shoreditch with street food, drinks and shopping with communal seating. If I was a local, I’d definitely spend a lot of time here – it’s such a fun place to socialize! Anyway, Soft Serve Society had just what my group needed after all of our food and drinks. Their menu features unique soft serve sundaes and cups, including matcha and charcoal coconut soft serve. Definitely stop here if you’re looking for some of the best dessert in London!</p>

<h2><a href="https://chinchinicecream.com/" target="_blank">Chin Chin Dessert Club</a></h2>
    <p>There are 3 of these memorable locations in London, and I was lucky enough to visit 2 of them! I couldn’t resist going back to <a href="https://chinchinicecream.com/" target="_blank">Chin Chin Ice Cream</a> for more. I first visited the shop in <a href="https://www.camdenmarket.com/" target="_blank">Camden Market</a> after a stroll through Camden Market where I got the brownie cookie sandwich. I got a cookie dough ice cream sundae from the Soho location. They were both absolutely perfect and worth the hype! I had seen their Instagram posts everywhere which feature their signature chocolate square with “Chin Chin Dessert Club” topped on every dessert. They are conveniently located in 2 of London’s most popular areas, so if you’re craving dessert in London, stop here!</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.bubblewraplondon.com/" target="_blank">Bubble Wrap</a></h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.bubblewraplondon.com/" target="_blank">Bubble Wrap</a> is a must when visiting London’s <a href="https://chinatown.co.uk/en/" target="_blank">Chinatown</a>. The spot was created to reinvent the traditional Hong Kong street snack egg waffles, and is now essentially a fresh, warm waffle cone with your choice of ice cream and toppings. It was cold out when I got my “Oreo Up” which had vanilla gelato, Oreo and Nutella, but the cold didn’t even bother me! It was insanely flavorful and you can tell that the ingredients are fresh and high quality. It was a perfect addition to my stroll through Chinatown. If you are in the Chinatown area and looking for a dessert spot, then Bubble Wrap is for you!</p>

    <p>Located in my favorite area of London, <a href="https://www.coventgarden.london/" target="_blank">Covent Garden</a>, <a href="https://www.dominiqueanselny.com/introducing-dominique-ansel-treehouse-a-new-bistro-bakery-opening-in-londons-covent-garden-in-february-2020/" target="_blank">Dominique Ansel Treehouse</a> is a lovely bakery and bistro featuring a modern treehouse design inspired by exploration and imagination. I only got a chocolate chip cookie (which was amazing by the way) but the entire atmosphere inside of the store and out was stunning and drew me in. All of their desserts are created with the utmost attention to detail and are creatively put together. If you are looking for a whimsical spot in London to grab dessert, or even a meal, stop by Dominique Ansel!</p>

<h2><a href="https://uk.venchi.com/venchi-chocolate-and-gelato-london-covent-garden" target="_blank">Venchi</a></h2>
    <p><a href="https://uk.venchi.com/venchi-chocolate-and-gelato-london-covent-garden" target="_blank">Venchi</a>, located right in the middle of <a href="https://www.coventgarden.london/" target="_blank">Covent Garden</a>, provides fancy chocolate and artisan gelato made in Italy and using all natural quality ingredients. My friends and I grabbed gelato here one night and all of us were obsessed with the flavor! Venchi is a great option if you are in Covent Garden and looking for something sweet!</p>

<br>

<h2><a href="https://doughnuttime.co.uk/" target="_blank">Doughnut Time</a></h2>
    <p>You can find a <a href="https://doughnuttime.co.uk/" target="_blank">Doughnut Time</a> anywhere in London. I am instinctively skeptical of chains, but I was wrong! Their stores feature doughnuts that are handmade fresh every day, and their websites warns that if the stores sell out they will close earlier than their listed times! I ate the Bueno Mars which has hazelnut cream filling, a milk and dark chocolate glaze with Nutella, wafer, and Kinder Bueno pieces.</p>

<br>

<h2><a href="https://cremelondon.com/" target="_blank">Crème</a></h2>
    <p>I had truly felt the hype of visiting <a href="https://cremelondon.com/" target="_blank">Crème</a> beforehand, how could I not? Located in Soho, they have the cutest packaging and are featured constantly on London food Instagrammer’s pages. When I got to Cremè there was a line out the door, which was no biggie. I ordered my favorite, just a chocolate chip cookie. It was served warm but when I opened it I noticed there were barely any chocolate chips (pictured on the top left side) and the cookie itself was extremely doughy. I was very disappointed as I constantly see raving reviews. I may try again since so many people talk about the banana chocolate chip cookie there. I may have just gotten an unproportionally packed cookie, but if you happen to pass Crème see for yourself!</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.amorino.com/en-us" target="_blank">Amorino Gelato</a></h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.amorino.com/en-us" target="_blank">Amorino Gelato</a>’s adorable cherub logo is all over London (and the world). They have a ton of different flavors and can make your gelato into an adorable little rose if you’d like. You can’t go wrong with any flavor of theirs! They also have other desserts such as crêpes, chocolates, waffles and sorbet.</p>

<br>

<h2><a href="https://www.caffeconcerto.co.uk/" target="_blank">Caffè Concerto</a></h2>
    <p>There are a TON of <a href="https://www.caffeconcerto.co.uk/" target="_blank">Caffè Concerto</a>’s conveniently located around London to satisfy any sweet tooth you may have. My boyfriend and I stopped here before we headed back to our AirBnB for the night. We ordered a blueberry tart, a slice of tiramisu, chocolate cake and another slice of cake I can’t remember! They were all amazing though – I remember the blueberries being so sweet and just right. It was great to have some yummy sweets at our stay. You can’t go wrong stopping here for dessert in London!</p>
